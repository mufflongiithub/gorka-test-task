This site is a test project created in Figma for a web developer position at the company «Art Gorka» in my hometown. The project includes many challenging aspects that are difficult for me, which has a significant impact on my skills. Working on this project encourages me to read articles and take additional courses to build a solid foundation in web layout programming. Starting with the basics, I aim to develop a fully adaptive product using CSS bundles and applying JavaScript for dynamic content.
